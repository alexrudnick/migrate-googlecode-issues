Tool to move issues from Google Code projects to github projects.

Nothing against Google Code! It's just that sometimes projects move.

Written in Python 2, because the gdata APIs are in Python 2.

Requires the gdata-python-client library, available here:
http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

To use: edit the variables at the top of main() so they have your desired
source and target projects, and also your usernames and passwords for both
sites.

Cheers!
